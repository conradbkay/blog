# Multiple outputs

There's actually three dimensions for a graded comic

You may have notice the small "CREAM TO OFF-WHITE Pages" text 

![](owl.jpg)

Basically the only useful visual information is whatever tiny sliver of the interior pages we can see, and the year. Year of course because we're measuring aging, but even more than that because comics stopped being printed on pulp/newsprint in the mid 90s, instead using a glossy paper that doesn't age.

"Restoration is the act of adding foreign material to a comic book through certain techniques to return its appearance to an ideal or original state" ([]<https://www.cgccomics.com/resources/restoration/>). Colloquially referred to as the "Purple Label of Death" since it kills the valuation of any comic unlucky enough to receive it. 

The amount of data available is much more limited, since most comics are unrestored, and there's 11 different types of restoration. Luckily the grading label itself says each type of restoration performed! So you can train a model to output the probability of each class separately 

# Other dimensions

Cleaning and pressing are restoration methods that the grading companies allow

A CGC 9.4 could come back a 9.8 after a clean and or press

Pressing inherently only works on defects which don't affect color (mostly bends, indents, warping)

That means lighting differences from depth is what makes it visible, which is somewhat lacking from the 2d scans. From CGC themselves, "unfortunately, scans are not a reliable method of determining press potential"

I'd argue the model giving grades post pressing is a bit more of a feature than a bug
