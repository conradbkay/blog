I've mostly worked on my own projects, so I haven't *needed* to give a lot of estimates. 

The plan is as follows: before I touch any code I'll specify a task, do some planning, then estimate a median and 90th percentile for how long I think it'll take. When I'm done I'll write a bit about how it went and what caused any slowdowns.

It'll be nice to have data for what I should multiply my intuited estimates by. I'll try my best but we all know it'll be > 1 because:

> Hofstadter's law: It always takes longer than you expect, even when you take into account Hofstadter's law.

I started a basic project management app 6 years ago now, just to learn fullstack development.

It was on Heroku back when they had a free tier, so the first task will be to get it hosted again. I don't feel like paying for more domains so it'll live at <http://mantella.conradkay.com/> for now. 

I also want to use pm2, Dockerize it, and make deploying to prod take 1 command. Sounds like maybe 2 hours to me. Nothing crazy and I've gone through most of the headaches before so I'll go with 2x that for the p90.

79 minutes, maybe I work better when the clock is ticking. I ended up refactoring some code and fixing a bug with the text editor, both of which I hadn't anticipated.

On Day 2 I forgot to do anything for this, maybe since I was doing more exploratory development and going wherever the code took me. But I thought about the parallels to this and my last project. Then I thought it could be cool to have LLMs try and estimate the same tasks as I do, and see if they fare any better. 

That could be a bit annoying to implement, so I thought about just writing a quick something to do it automatically for tasks in Mantella.
